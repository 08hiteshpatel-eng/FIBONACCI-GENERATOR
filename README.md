# FIBONACCI-GENERATOR
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of the Fibonacci series, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The Fibonacci sequence is defined using a mathematical recurrence relation and is widely used in computer science, mathematics, and nature-inspired algorithms.
#Features:

Generates Fibonacci numbers up to a given term or limit

Supports both iterative and recursive implementations

Clean and beginner-friendly code

Easily customizable


# Mathematical Formula:

> F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
with base cases: F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1



# Tech Stack:

Language: Python (or specify another language if used)


 # Use Cases:

Learning recursion and loops

Algorithm practice

Exploring sequence generation
