# FIBONACCI-GENERATOR
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of the Fibonacci series, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The Fibonacci sequence is defined using a mathematical recurrence relation and is widely used in computer science, mathematics, and nature-inspired algorithms.
